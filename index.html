            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h4>The game is about air pollution, and the goal of it is to fix the earth. What happens is that you start out with some money, some knowledge on the topic, and some followers. The air pollution level (Based on the "Air Quality Health Index" in Hong Kong) is high, and, in order to survive, you must use the proposals given to you to earn money, gain followers, and even directly affecting the pollution increase and decrease levels to get the pollution to zero. Good luck!</h4>
            </div>
            <h2>How To Play</h2>
            <h4>You have to make several choices to play the game. First of all, go into the game tab. Then, click start the game. <h6>"This will be the hardest choice you will ever make throughout the entire gamepIay, if I'm gonna be brutally honest" - Hyder</h6><br></h4>
            <h4>
              You should see a proposal and several buttons should pop up. These buttons will be your "Options", while the proposal is what the options are reffering to. Select the option that you think will seem the best, with the "best" being something that will help the environment. <br><br>
              The goal of the game is to get your pollution level really low, while the public awareness should be high. <br><br>
              Be careful, because your Pollution Increase per turn will add to your pollution. And once the pollution fills up the progress bar, you're dead! Another way to die would be to go bankrupt, so don't do that either. Good luck!</h4><br>
              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <h4>We are a group of students from a school called Creative Secondary School, and we're making this website in order to advocate about the effect of Air Pollution. Yes, it's a common topic, but we're trying to do something original, yet old-fashioned - A game. We think it's a good idea, as we can entice other people in our generations, such as Gen Z and Millenials. While they have fun, they learn about Air Pollution and what others can do about them - a Great Trade-off! Our group consists of me, Zion, the Game Dev, Hyder, the Graphics Designer, and Thomas, the <em>Conceptualist</em> </h4><h6>big words haha</h6><h4>Good luck with the game and have fun! :D</h4>
